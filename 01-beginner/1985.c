The MacPRONALTS is with a super promotion, exclusive to the contestants of the first Selective MaratonaTEC. But they had a problem, all runners were trying to buy at the same time, so this generated a very long queue. The worst is that the cashier girl no have calculator or a program to help her to calculate more quickly. You are the person that will help the girl and the MacPRONALTS increase their sells. Bellow has a menu day, that contains the product number and its value.

1001 | R$ 1.50

1002 | R$ 2.50

1003 | R$ 3.50

1004 | R$ 4.50

Obs .: the product number will not be repeated.

Timelimit: 1
You get so happy at Christmas that you want to scream at everyone: "Merry Christmas!!". To put all this happiness out, you've wrote a program that, given an I index of happiness, your Christmas scream is more lively.

Input
The input consists of an integer I (1 < I â‰¤ 104) that represents that happiness index.

Output
The output consists of the phrase "Feliz natal!" ("Merry Christmas" in Portuguese), and the last a of the sentence is repeated I times. A line break is necessary after printing the sentence.

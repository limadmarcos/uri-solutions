The semester is over at South Transylvania University. Every grade was closed, and only Alchemy 104 havenâ€™t published its list of approved students.

Therefore, you should show the word 'Approved: ' alongisde the the name of a student and the grade, for those who have been approved (grade â‰¥7).

Remember to sort the list by grade (higher grades first).
